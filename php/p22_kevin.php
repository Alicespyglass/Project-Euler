/*  Problem 22: Names scores
 *  -----
 *  Using names.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 46K text file
 *  containing over five-thousand first names, begin by sorting it into
 *  alphabetical order. Then working out the alphabetical value for each name,
 *  multiply this value by its alphabetical position in the list to obtain a
 *  name score.
 *
 *  For example, when the list is sorted into alphabetical order, COLIN, which
 *  is worth 3 + 15 + 12 + 9 + 14 = 53, is the 938th name in the list. So,
 *  COLIN would obtain a score of 938 Ã— 53 = 49714.
 *
 *  What is the total of all the name scores in the file?
